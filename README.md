# math-quals-questions
Lists of practice questions for the Mathematics Qualifying Exams at UC Berkeley for Algebraic Number Theory, Probability Theory, and Complex Analysis. Includes a "quizzer" for each topic to randomly generate questions from specified sections/chapters.

To see how these fit into my preparation for the Qualifying Exam as well as advice I've compiled for the exam check out [my website](https://amichaelsen-math.github.io/quals/)
